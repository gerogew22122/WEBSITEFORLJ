## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- Uses React Server Components (RSC) architecture
- Client-side interactivity handled with "use client" directive
- Pages are built as React components in the `app` directory

**UI Component Library:** shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- Custom theme configuration using "new-york" style
- Components use Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Icon library: Lucide React

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Uses OKLCH color space for better color management
- Dark mode as default theme
- Custom CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
- Animated elements using custom CSS animations and tw-animate-css

**State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- No global state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Loading states and popup visibility managed at page level

**Typography:** Custom font configuration
- Inter: Primary sans-serif font (weights: 300-900)
- Bebas Neue: Display font for headings

### Key Design Patterns

**Component Structure:**
- Modular component architecture with single-responsibility components
- Components organized by feature (hero, navigation, features, etc.)
- Shared UI components in `components/ui` directory
- Business logic components in root `components` directory

**Animation Strategy:**
- Multi-stage loading screen with typing effect and timed transitions (6.5s total)
- Typing animation at 45ms per character with consistent Inter font
- Fade-out transition (700ms + 800ms delay) to main page
- CSS-based animations for performance (transform, opacity)
- Clean gradient backgrounds with subtle blue accent glow
- Scroll-based navigation state changes

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg)
- Text scales appropriately across devices (3xl â†’ 7xl for headlines)
- Loading screen text optimized for mobile viewports
- Clean, centered layouts that work on all screen sizes
- No competing visuals - focus on content and clarity

**User Flow:**
1. Loading screen with brand reveal animation and typing effect (6.5s)
2. Smooth fade transition to main page (700ms fade + 800ms delay)
3. Professional hero section with high-converting CTA and credible metrics
4. Auto-popup appears after 5 seconds with "use code FREE at checkout" offer
5. Promo banner with discount code
6. Feature highlights in card grid
7. Results/statistics section
8. Customer reviews
9. Footer with navigation and social links
10. Manual promotional popup triggered by CTA button click

### Performance Considerations

**Image Optimization:**
- Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Priority loading for hero images
- Lazy loading for below-fold content

**Code Splitting:**
- Automatic code splitting via Next.js App Router
- Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Dynamic imports where appropriate

**SEO:**
- Metadata configuration in layout.tsx
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy

## External Dependencies

### Notable Architecture Decisions

**No Backend/Database:**

- Content is hardcoded in components
- Future expansion could add form submissions or user authentication

**Dark Theme Default:**
- HTML element has `dark` class by default
- CSS variables configured for dark mode color scheme
- Professional navy-to-black gradient backgrounds
- No theme toggle currently implemented

**Professional UX Design:**
- Loading screen with typing effect (6.5-second sequence)
- Smooth fade transitions (700ms) for polished feel
- Scroll prevention during loading
- Timed transitions between animation stages
- Performance considerations with CSS transforms over layout changes
- Mobile-responsive text sizing for all devices

**Credible Messaging & Conversion Focus:**
- Hero section emphasizes credibility: "Verified 72% Win Rate Since 2021"
- Single high-converting CTA: "ðŸŽ¯ GET 7 DAYS FREE NOW" with pulse animation
- Clean, professional design without distracting imagery
- Social proof: "1,000+ Active Members"
- Clear value proposition: "Get verified picks and pro analysis from full-time experts"
- Auto-popup appears 5 seconds after loading with "use code FREE at checkout" message
- Manual popup modal triggered by CTA button
- Promo code banner for discount awareness

## Replit Migration Configuration

**Migration Date:** October 14, 2025

### Port & Host Configuration
- Development server: `next dev -p 5000 -H 0.0.0.0`
- Production server: `next start -p 5000 -H 0.0.0.0`
- Port 5000 is required for Replit compatibility
- Binding to 0.0.0.0 allows external access through Replit's proxy

### Package Manager
- **pnpm** with special configuration for Next.js 15 compatibility
- `.npmrc` settings:
  - `shamefully-hoist=true` - Hoists all dependencies to root for better module resolution
  - `auto-install-peers=true` - Automatically installs peer dependencies
  - `strict-peer-dependencies=false` - Allows flexibility in peer dependency versions

### Next.js Configuration Adjustments
- `transpilePackages: ['lucide-react', '@radix-ui/react-slot']` - Required for ESM module compatibility
- `experimental.esmExternals: 'loose'` - Enables loose ESM external handling for pnpm
- `images.unoptimized: true` - Disables image optimization for simpler deployment

### Workflow
- **Dev Server:** `pnpm run dev` on port 5000
- Configured with webview output type for browser preview
- Auto-restarts on file changes via Next.js Fast Refresh

### Deployment
- **Target:** Autoscale (stateless website)
- **Build command:** `pnpm run build`
- **Run command:** `pnpm run start`
- Production deployment uses Next.js standalone output for efficiency
